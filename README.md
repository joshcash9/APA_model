# APA_model

APA_model.py simulates a simple, open-loop, double mass-spring-damper system to roughly model the dynamics of a voluntary rapid movement. This code uses the Casadi non-linear optimization toolbox (Casadi.org) to solve for a control signal on M2 that will minimize a given cost function.
